# TeachingBitcoin
I first heard Andreas Antonopolis procliam, "Not your keys not your bitcoin," about a decade ago. I assumed everyone internalized this mantra, but noticed there are many bitcoiners who do not hold their own keys. Many freaks have spouses who don't know how to use bitcoin keys. The goal of this book is to teach them how to use bitcoin.
