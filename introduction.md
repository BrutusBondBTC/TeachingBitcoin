`“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” Satoshi Nakamoto`

 

I lost my retail management job at the tail end of the great financial crisis. I had a rough time getting a job, so I supplemented my unemployment by playing limit hold 'em at a local Indian casino 60 hours a week. Before the DOJ seized the PolerStars.com and FullTiltPoker.com domains on April 15th, 2011, I played 4 tables of $0.50-$1.00 limit Hold Em 25 hours a week. I didn't make much money, but I was profitable and the sites gave me free clothes. I began playing live games after that. They were more profitable because the players were less skilled and I could even make more I. Home games with no rake, the fee poker rooms charge players to keep the lights on.

I took a stop gap warehouse job when my unemployment ran out because 60 hours a week for minium wage was not worth the grind. It was low paying physical work. Everyone made fun of me because I had a college degree. It paid a couple bucks more than minimum wage though. They also let me listen to music as long as I kept one ear bud out. I figured I could use the time to catch up on some audiobooks and the podcasts.

I first heard about bitcoin from Andreas Antooplis  in July of 2014 on the Joe Rogan Experience. He said 25 Bitcoin were mined every ten minutes and something called the difficulty adjustment kept it that way. The new supply gets cut in half every 4 years. In a couple of years, it would only be 12.5. 

This piqued my interest because my high school economics teacher was part owner of a bank which was too small to succeed in the 1980's before he became a teacher. He said you only needed 3 million dollars to start a bank back then because of something called fractional reserve banking. An astute Bitcoiner will recognize there is no reserve anymore, but in my senior year, banks were still required to hold 10% on reserve. That meant when my parents had a hundred bucks in the bank, the bank kept their deposit safe. That money was there's. It did not get loaned out like you see in movies like It's A Wonderful Life.

Banks had magical wizard powers that created $900 in new money when my parents deposit a hundred bucks into their checking account. That new money became an asset on the banks balance sheet. They loaned it out and charged  interest. If the loan was paid in full, the new money stayed in the economy. If the loan was not paid back, like what happened in 2008, the new money vanished into the thin air it came from.

You know how Guy Swann likes to call this the “counterfeit class?” I wasn't clever enough to come up with something so sophisticated. I called it fucking bullhit. The peons had to work long-ass hours for money to pay off loans give  by banks that just pulled  the money out of their ass! Why was nobody talking about this? It's so unfair! I couldn't believe people were not rioting in the streets over this. I consider this my real Orange Pill moment, but bitcoin wouldn't be discovered for another 13 years.

I also got into Napster in the year 2000 because my brother majored in Computer Science at the time and Peer 2 Peer technology was  becoming prominent.  My brother built his own p2p music program for a school project. We downloaded as much music as we could over dial up internet service. It took about 35 minutes to download a song unless someone picked up the telephone, an ancient communications device that was plugged into an RJ11 jack, more commonly called a telephone jack. You can still find these jacks in kitchen's built before the 2010's. It looks like a mini me of the RJ45 jack(a.k.a. ethernet jack). I was hard core Napster nerd. I pasted a Napster bumper sticker on my bumper and bought a Napster T-Shirt. I thought this technology would revolutionize the world and take power away from and corporations! Then the government shut it down.

Then the government shut down Napster. Until that moment, I thought the Internet was controlled by the People. I was wrong, but soon found BitTorrent, a decentralized p2p network. In 2004, [BitTorrent made up 20%-35% of all Internet traffic.]()

 

“How much is it now?”

"About 350 bucks. Like I said, i know it sounds crazy. but you know how I always say fuck the banks or bitch about fractional reserve banking? 

“Don't remind me.”

“Well, I think Bitcoin  is the solution.”

"I know $350 is a lot of money to us right now, but I think it would be a big mistake to not buy any."

I had my ideals. I had my reasons for liking the idea of bitcoin even without the NGU, but the thought of early retirement intrigued me. I stacked sats, but did not stay humble. I friviously spent bitcoin and used it as a poker bankroll. I kept a few buy ins and bought bitcoiin with my winnings. I only made about $15.00 an hour playing home games, but I kept my winnings in bitcion. When I went bust, I would sell a few more buy ins and buy bitcoin with it. I didn't realize it at the time, but poker taught me how to deal with the swings. My wife was not used to this lifestyle, but before I met her I played limit hold em about 60 hours a week. It was not a glamourous life. I made $15.00 and hour and decided it wasn't worth the grind. Besides, it would be really difficult to have a family grinding that much. 

 I was up. I had more bitcoin than I otherwise would have had. Then coinbase listed etherehum and litecoin. They were cheap. I think ethereu was $11. I don't rememver how  litecoion was, but I began trading my bitcoin. I watched some YouTube videos. I read  I told my wife we should buy these new coins on coinbase like ethereum and litecoin. I traded them for more bitcoin, at least that's what the book called it, but it was gambling. I was used to gambling because I wasn't so good at getting promotions at work and my savings account paid an obsene interest rate that did not keep up with 2% inflation. That's why I started gambling in the first place so gambling on crypto seemed like a good idea. I read Peter McCormack's trading guide. I followed his crypto influencer list on Twitter. I won some. I lost some. I had more bitcoin than I would have otherwise had. Until I didn't. That's when I learned to, "stay humble and stack sats, as Matt Odell says.

I'm pretty much bitcoin only now. I am basically all-in. I keep a few thousand dollars in a savings account because my wife insists we have enough money to cover the mortgage in case there's an emergency.  I also have 1 -T on Liquid. This is not investment advice. I don't think anyone should hold USD-T.. I know it's a shitcoin. I know it will go down in purchasing power as compared to bitcoin. I keep it as a memento for when the dollar dies. I plan on using the USD-T to show my grandchildren what people sued to think money was. I hold 1 USD-T on the Liquid side-chain for posterity. Tether is a token that represents a dollar which is backed US Treasury's. It has  a 100% reserve. Tether represents how I think banks should have operated before I ever heard about bitcoin. I hold this single USD-T for sentimental and ideological reasons.  The only problem with Tether is that it is backed by bonds which an be printed   of thin air.  Those bonds are the big elephant in the room. There are 34 trillion dollars worth of these unpaid bonds. Every 4 years, we have the most important election in history. We vote to see which old person  will be granted the power to increase the 34 trillion debt. They also have the power to change the chairman of the federal reserve, but they don't, until the chairman retires. The US monetary system is run by a dollar dictator. Just a few short weeks ago, the current dollar dictator went on 60 minutes and said this is a long term problem. In 30 years, the debt will make us all negative millionaires since the number will equate to 1 million dollars owed by each American. Your grandchildren will become indentured servants, working to pay off a debt that can never be repaid.You'll still get social security when you're as old as the President of The United States, but you'll be lucky if it buys you a bag of groceries every month.

Bitcoin is the only alternative. If  I was single, I would live in a van, but I have a family. My wife is awesome. We have a son, take care of my brother,  three dogs, and four cats. They don't make vansion's big enough for our family.  My wife, brother, and sister-in-law all tried to convince me we needed to buy a house Christmas of 2016. I told them I thought it was a better idea to buy bitcoin. They thought I was crazy. At the time, a hundred million sats cost  about $800.00. 

People often say the bull market is the hardest to hodl. That's because you need to tell your wife bitcoin is undervalued at 20k when you live in an apartment in the ghetto and she has dreamed of buying a home since she was a little girl. Many couples fight about money, but for the Bitcoiner, these fights are often more complex. It's often a disagreement about what money even is. I don't want to air our dirty laundry, but my wife has not fully swallowed the orange pill, but she doesn't think I'm crazy anymore. I like to stay humble and stack sats. She  likes to buy the dip.  She's not wrong. Buying the dip procures more generational wealth for our family. I am not against “buying the dip,” but I want to get on zero for ideological reasons. The infrastructure exists that makes this possible, but there's just one problem. My wife does not really know how to use bitcoin. She might have made a transaction or two on mainnet. I might have sent her a few bucks over the lightning network, but if I gave her all of my keys she would not know how to spend it. She has never read the Bitcoin Standard, doesn't know the meaning of the word, “praxeology,"

The title of this book might be, “I Will Teach Your Wife Bitcoin,” but the truth is, I'm scratching my own itch. This book is really a chronically of me teaching my own wife how to use bitcoin. I am writing it because I know many Bitcoiners find themselves in the same situation. We've been stacking for years, but our wives consider hate us using four letter words like “UTXO.” I would bet my whole stack that my wife could not tell you what a UTXO is. She likes to buy the dip and I prefer to get paid in bitcoin. She thinks bitcoin is an invention rather than a discovery. My favorite part of the Bitcoin white paper is “Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.” My wife wishes we could  just use a “Bitcoin bank.”

The goals of this book are:

    Teach my own wife what the words, “Not your keys, not your bitcoin” really mean.
    Teach her how to be a self-sovereign bitcoin owner.

Bitcoin Is Hard

 

I originally planned to title this book, the easy way to take self-custody of bitcoin, but I got stuck, but I learned an important lesson. There is no easy way to secure hard money. It's not rocket science though either. I believe anyone with the cognitive ability to read at a fifth grade level can use bitcoin on the bitcoin network. My wife is a very smart woman. She has a successful career. She's a bad-ass gardner and a kick-ass cook. She just is sick of me talking about bitcoin. She encouraged me to talk to other people about bitcoin by finding other nerds like me online and start a local meetup. She just doesn't want me to talk about bitcoin with her anymore. She's head my spiel for over a decade. She has no interest in learning how to use bitcoin, but there is no other way. Bitcoin is hard money.

There is no easy way to get around this. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and this system has rules. According to Ludvig Von Mises, [value is subjective](https://highlighter.com/blog@bloggingbitcoin.store/a68d50eb980bb21aec) . Bitcoin is objective. It is a set of rules everyone in the network agrees upon. It is what [Knut Svanholm calls absolute mathematical scarcity[](https://twitter.com/knutsvanholm/status/1401083311557054470) He compares bitcoin to the circle. The circle was an important discovery, but any copy cat casino coins are slighty modified circles. You are free to change the shape of a circle, but it ceases to be a circle. Ethereum is not absolute scarcity in the same way a triangle is not a circle. 

 In reality, a bitcoin key is not a circle. It uses [elliptic key cryptography](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/elliptic-curve-cryptography/).  Cryptography is a branch of mathematics like geometry in the same way geometry is a branch of mathematics. The circle is part of the geometry branch of mathmatics.  A bitcoin key shown on a graph looks more like the nipple of a baby bottle than a circle.  This makes sense because even a genius like Satoshi Nakamoto cannot re-discover the circle. He took this eliptic key cryptography and added several features that were discovered before he created the peer-to-peer electronic system.  He did not do this for fame. He was not awarded a Nobel Prize. Nobody knows who he actually is. He created a new monetary system based on absolute rules. I subjectively believe bitcoin is undervalued because almost 8 billion people on the planet do not understand it. At the time of this writing, 100,000,000 sats is worth 25.5 ounces of gold. Bitcoin has many features that are better than gold, like being able to send it through a communications channel instead of sending ships to a country only to come back empty handed.

I use gold as a comparison because gold is a better yardstick than the US dollar. Gold is objective and has what Bitcoin hater Nasim Nicholas Taleb calls the Lindy effect. A finite supply of gold exists on the earth,. We do not know how much exists. We do not know if a golden astroid will hit the earth and increase the supply in the future, but it has been used as money for thousands of years, until 1971. We also know there are about [3000 metric tons of gold](https://highlighter.com/blog@bloggingbitcoin.store/5a897d1a16bb63738d). But we can [measure gold produciton](https://highlighter.com/blog@bloggingbitcoin.store/3c454ee4d89f3b3edf). We can be reasonably sure how much gold will be produced in the next ten years, but [the gold standard failed due to trusted third parties]

9https://highlighter.com/blog@bloggingbitcoin.store/9d5d55d7ad3100e12a).

Most people prefer to compare the price of bitcoin to the price of the US dollar, but fiat, like Pinocchio's nose, is a poor yardstick.  Fiat is not an honest money. It is a money some people get for doing nothing and some people need to work for. It is not a monetary system built on an objective standard. Central banks, governments, big banks, regional banks, and small banks can create it out of thin air. Gold. like bitcoin was a discovery. Fiat is an invention rather than a discovery. It is the easiest money the world has ever known. Governments no longer need to print portraits of dead presidents on pieces of cotton paper. They just hit control + p. Abra-Cadabra. People who own assets get rich. People who don't own assets get poor.
Real Estate Number Go Down

I was the first person in my family to graduate college. My parent's bought a home in a suburb of California in March of 1990 for the price of $134,000. The interest was high, like 11% or something, but they refinanced several times. They took out equity to make repairs and other stuff. They live on Social Security. They say it It will never be paid off but it is worth $555,555 Most people see that as an 445% price increase because they use money that grows like Pinocchio''s nose as a unit of account. On the day my parent's bought there home, the price of gold was 406.40 per ounce. Therefore, in 1990, it cost about 329.73 ounces of gold. This same amount of gold is worth 663,888.53 or 275.99 ounces of gold  today. When measured in gold, my parents home lost 17% of its value in 34 years. This assumes they paid cash for the house, but they have a mortgage. They paid interest on that mortgage for 34 years. They replaced floors, countertops, windows , water heaters and who knows what else in that house over 34 years so they have definitely spent more than $134,000 on their home.
Take The Orange Pill

We call leaning about bitcoin going down the rabbit hole. When I first heard this in 2014, I thought it refereed to Alice In Wonderland. She follows the rabbit who is late for a very important date and falls down the rabbit hole. I was wrong, Alice In Wonderland did not take a pill. It turns out, the reference comes from [another movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7PKRjrid4)

The Matrix is all around us. You can see it when you look out your window or turn on your television.

When you go to work.
When you go to church.
When you pay your taxes.

It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes, to blind you from the truth.

"What Truth?"

That you are a slave Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you can not spell or taste or touch. A prison…for your mind.

Unfortunately, nobody van be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

You take the green pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

You take the orange pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Remember, All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

Follow me.

I did not price my parents house in gold to convince you to buy gold. Besides a little jewelry I keep for sentimental reasons, I don't own any gold. When I first studied bitcoin there were only The white paper, Satoshi's forum posts, and a handful of podcasts and Andreas Antonopolis's YouTube channel. I read stuff by  wei-dai, Adam Back, and Nick Szabo. Digital Gold, by Nathanial Popper was just about the only bitcoin book written for people who don't know how to write code. 

Popper is now a notorious no-coiner.He says he did not have permission from the New York Times to buy it. It's ironic because Bitcoin is a permission-less, distributed computer network. This illustrates that you can learn all the technical details of bitcoin, but still prefer dollars, the prestige of writing for a major newspaper, and other fiat stuff. To learn how to use bitcoin, you must first learn to accept the truth. You can't learn how to use bitcoin until you take the orange pill.

I cannot force you to take it. You can take the green pill and go back to believing your house will be worth more than you paid for it in 30 years.  You will feel the same when you go to work, go to church, or pay your taxes.  While you work, you will not realize you were born in bondage. Once you take the Orange pill, you stay in Wonderland and nothing will look the same again.  You will turn on your television. You will watch people debate pronouns and believe Zillow when it says the person who owns your house is rich. Maybe that person is you. Maybe it is not. Maybe you believe the old person wearing the blue tie will pick the best chairman of the federal reserve.   Maybe you think the old person wearing the red tie picks the better chairman of the federal reserve.   You will view “the world that has been pulled over your eyes, to blind you from the truth”.

[Bitcoin is not a belief](https://habla.news/u/blog@bloggingbitcoin.store/bitcoin-is-not-a-belief). It is a group of people voluntarily accepting a set of rules. The rules can be changed, but rule changes require 95% of the participants in the network to agree upon these changes. One thing is almost 100% certain. 99.99% of the people running bitcoin will not agree to mining more than 20.99999898 million bitcoin. You can identify as whoever you want to be when the look at the world that has been pulled over your eyes. You can identify as a purple giraffe. Some people will take you seriously. Some people will not. You can spend hours online arguing about who is right. 

Bitcoin does not work like this.  I can identify as Satoshi. Some people will believe me. Others will not, but if I can't sign a message with Satoshi's PGP key or spend some of his early bitcoin, no one can verify I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I can identify as Hal Finney, but unless I have access to Hal Finney's keys, I cannot spend Hal Finney's bitcoin. Unlike fiat clown world, bitcoin is not subjective. The monetary supply of bitcoin does not grow like Pinocchio's nose.

If your significant other dies, it does not matter if you think you own a million whole bitcoin. If you do not posses the seeds to spend that bitcoin, you and your posterity will HODL forever. This will make everyone else on the network more wealthy.

“Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone,” Satoshi Nakamoto


If you are okay with that fact, you can stop reading. Go back to being a slave in the Matrix. My family will get richer. Retire off the money in your 401K. Collect social security. Eat popcorn filled with seed oils while you pop pills, watch the national debt go to the moon, and get your medical bills paid by medicare.

If you take the orange pill, read on.
